# One-shot pre-merge step for the invoice PO-number PR. Run it ON the production box as root,
# BEFORE merging the PR:
#
#   cd /opt/dashmani-platform && git fetch origin feat/sales-manual-number-and-edit
#   git show origin/feat/sales-manual-number-and-edit:scripts/apply-sales-invoice-po-ddl.sh > /root/apply-sales-invoice-po-ddl.sh
#   bash /root/apply-sales-invoice-po-ddl.sh
#
# Same shape as scripts/apply-sales-recurring-ddl.sh:
#   1. extracts scripts/sales-invoice-po-ddl.sql and schema.prisma from the PR branch (`git show`;
#      the checkout the apps run from is never touched);
#   2. takes DATABASE_URL (the dashmani app role) from apps/api/.env and refuses any other role;
#   3. read-only pre-flight: sales_invoices exists, is owned by that role, nothing holds a long lock;
#   4. schema-only backup;
#   5. applies the DDL — one transaction, lock_timeout 3s, ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS;
#   6. verifies the 2 new columns;
#   7. drift check (inspect only): no sales_invoices statement may remain between the database and
#      the PR's schema.prisma.
# It restarts nothing and changes no file in /opt/dashmani-platform. Safe to re-run. Exit 0 = every
# step passed; 1 = a step failed (the output says whether the DDL was applied); 2 = applied and
# verified but the drift check could not run.
